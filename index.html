                <p>Why do we use it?</p>  
                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p><br/>
                  <p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. </p><br/>
                    <p>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
